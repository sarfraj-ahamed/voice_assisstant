# Voice Assistant AI 🎤🤖

Welcome to the **Voice Assistant AI** project! This Python-based application uses natural language processing (NLP) to recognize and process voice commands. It allows users to interact with their system through voice commands to perform various tasks. Built using the **SpeechRecognition** and **pyttsx3** libraries.

## Features 🔑
- **Speech Recognition** 🎙️: Convert spoken language into text using **Google Web Speech API**.
- **Text-to-Speech** 🔊: Respond with voice output using **pyttsx3**.
- **Voice Command Processing** 🧠: Execute tasks like opening apps, web searches, setting reminders, etc.
- **Custom Commands** 🛠️: Add your own custom voice commands.
- **User-Friendly** 👨‍💻: Interact with the system hands-free using only voice.

## How It Works ⚙️
1. **Listen to Commands** 🎧: The assistant continuously listens for commands using **SpeechRecognition**.
2. **Process Commands** 🧠: Convert speech into text and identify the task to be performed.
3. **Execute Tasks** 🖥️: Execute predefined tasks (e.g., opening apps, searching the web).
4. **Provide Feedback** 🗣️: Respond with voice feedback using **pyttsx3**.
